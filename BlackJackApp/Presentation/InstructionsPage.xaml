            <TextBlock x:Name="_lblBlackJackInstructionsBlock" HorizontalAlignment="Center" TextWrapping="Wrap" Text="In Blackjack, there is a player and a dealer. The game consists of rounds, and these rounds can be played so long has the user chips to bet. Each round starts by the user betting money, the minimum bet is $10, and the game is played with $10 chips ONLY. Once a bet has been made, the user can then start the round. Upon starting, the dealer will give the user two cards, both facing up, and the dealer gives himself two cards, one face down, the other facing up. The score of the user's hand is shown at the bottom, while the score of the dealer's hand is unknown. The goal is to get to or as close to 21 as possible. The user is then given the option to 'Hit', where they recieve an additonal card to increase their score. This can be done as many times as the user wants, but if they get a score above 21, they 'bust', and lose the round. The user can also 'Hold' if they wish to stay at their current score. This can be done after a 'Hit' or on the original cards. When the user holds, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer first flips over their card that is face down, and their score is visible. The dealer must 'hit' until they reach a score of at least 17. Once they reach that score, they can no longer hit. If they reach a score of above 21, the dealer 'busts', and the player wins. If neither the dealer or player 'bust', then whomever has the higher score wins the round. If both scores are the same, the round ends in a draw. If the user wishest to play another round, they can bet again and start another round wiht a new hand and bet. If the user is out of money, they cannot play. The user, if confident with their original hand, can 'Double', where they double their bet for the current round. When doubling down, the user can draw only ONE additonal card, and then it is the dealer's turn. The user can only 'double' on their initial cards. If the user starts with any ten value card (ten, jack, queen, king) and an ace (has two values: 1 and 11), then they got 'blackjack', and the round will end right away. If the dealer also got a 'blackjack', then the round ends in a draw. If just the player got 'blackjack', the player wins, if just the dealer got 'blackjack', the dealer wins. In terms of payout, if the player loses a round, they lost whatever they bet. If the player wins the round, they get double what they bet (if the user doubled down they receive two times what their double down bet was), if the round is a draw, the player gets what they bet back, and if the player gets 'blackjack', they get triple what they bet. In terms of aces, they have two values: 1 and 11. The 1 is known as a 'hard' ace and the 11 is known as the 'soft' ace. If the user gets an ace in their hand, they will be shown two different score values, one of which has the ace as a 1, and the other has the ace as 11. These are known as 'hard' and 'soft' hands respectively. If the 'soft' (higher score) hand reaches a score above 21, the player does not 'bust', but are rather forced to use the ace as a 1 ('hard' ace). There can only be one 'soft' ace in a hand, the others (if received) are treated as 'hard' aces. If the player 'holds' when they have a 'hard' and 'soft' value, their final score is set to their 'soft' hand value as it is the higher score. The dealer has 'soft' and 'hard' hands as well, and they stop 'hitting' if their 'soft' value reaches 17 or above."
